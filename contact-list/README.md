The instructions on this workshop need some work. They were super confusing. Specifically the "Selected Contact View" tab. It would tell you to do one thing then the example contradicts the instructions. I spent too much time wondering what I was supposed to be doing. I'm putting a pin in this one for now. Got very stuck around #8 on that "Selected Contact View" tab. 

Also, why do none of the workshops use arrow functions?
